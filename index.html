  <h2>Biography</h2>
  <div class="bio-content">
    <p>Rong Zhang is a doctoral candidate in the Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) program at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Her research, "The Localization of Bel Canto in Chinese National Vocal Music Through the Lens of Coloratura Soprano," explores how Western classical vocal technique can be adapted within Chinese national vocal traditions, with a focus on stylistic embodiment and cross-cultural pedagogy.</p>

    <p>Rong completed her master's degree at Yunnan Arts University in 2019 and subsequently spent three years teaching voice at Yunnan University of Economics and Management, in addition to working with various music training institutions in China. She also holds certified teaching qualifications for both university and high school levels in China.</p>

    <p>With over 15 years of vocal training, Rong has distinguished herself as both a performer and educator. She has received multiple provincial-level first prizes in China and, since moving to New Zealand, has achieved numerous accolades, including six first prizes and three third prizes at the Dunedin Vocal Competition, and a second prize at the Christchurch Competition Society in 2024.</p>

    <p>Her artistic practice spans opera, art song, and contemporary vocal music, with performances in China, New Zealand, and the United States. She has appeared at international music festivals, academic symposia, and public recitals, most recently participating in staged productions and vocal showcases at the Sewanee Summer Music Festival in the United States.</p>

    <p>As both a researcher and teacher, Rong is committed to developing culturally responsive approaches to vocal training. Her current projects examine localized interpretations of Western operatic repertoire and explore methods that bridge global technique with local traditions. Through her combined work in performance, education, and scholarship, she seeks to foster dialogue between Western and Chinese vocal practices, contributing to the evolving landscape of cross-cultural music education and performance.</p>
